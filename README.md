About
============

This page provides information about the project developed in Labcontrol called ["Shaking table with MR-damper."](http://www.anvargas.com/blog/mrdamper.html)  Experiments were carried out in practice in a laboratory testbed, and the data contained in this Github repository were collected in those experiments.

**Please check more details about this project in the page detailing the ["Shaking table with MR-damper."](http://www.anvargas.com/blog/mrdamper.html)**


`maincode.m` is a MATLAB(R) script that calls Simulink-Matlab and generates simulation data. The script also generates figures. The figures contain both simulation and real-time data collected in a laboratory testbed.

For more details about the experimental data, as long as the corresponding academic publications, please visit [the project page](http://www.anvargas.com/blog).


Installation
============

1. Extract the ZIP file (or clone the git repository) in your computer.
2. Add the folders `matlab-code/` and `data/` to your path in MATLAB/Octave: e.g. 
    - using the "Set Path" dialog in MATLAB, or 
    - by running the `addpath` function from your command window or `startup` script.

Make sure that you are running Matlab 2017a (or a newer version). Older versions may work, but it is uncertain.

Usage
=====

Typical usage of `maincode.m` consists of running it in your MATLAB. The code generates ten figures.

MATLAB
------
  1. Run `maincode.m`.
